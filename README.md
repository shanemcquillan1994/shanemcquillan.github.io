Here you will find a list of Project I have taken part of.

1) Kaggle Competition for Predicting House Prices using Machine learning.

My main reasoning for choosing this competition was mostly down to the fact that there was test data available for Kaggle to evaluate my performance. From checking out the list of available competitions with available test data , this competition was the most interesting to me. This competition allowed me to put most of what we learned within my postgraduate studies to practice.

While I understand this is not a featured competition with cash prize  , this competition did provide significant challenges for and required a steep learning curve when it came to my python capabilities prior to undertaking it. 
	
From this competition I learned a lot about additional models available within pythons scikit learn library.  Some of the models I implemented within this assignment were not necessarily covered in much depth within class , so it was very beneficial in that regard. All in all , this competition allowed me to demonstrate my  knowledge of machine learning techniques, my ability to apply technical skills to build actual machine learning models, and showed capacity to evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

 At the time of submission , I finished within the to 82nd Percentile of submissions.
  
  
2) Fifa Data Analysis Using R

For the purpose of data exploration and analysis , I wanted to take a look in to publicly available data regarding FIFA 19.
fIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Sports. The first ever game of Fifa was developed in the year 1993 under the title "Fifa International Soccer".  Over the years the game has seen a dramatic increase in quality and every year pushes the barrier in game development. It is in my opinion that the Data set gathered from this game is probably the most accurate data set publicly available that can represent real world professional soccer. 

Within this R Markdown notebook I explore the Data set and try to get a better picture of the data along the way.

3) Visualisation and analysis of Irelands National Hospitals on case by case basis

I wanted to explore a problem frequently gets discussed within the Irish media from year to year. That being the Irish health system and the problems identified with it. After some research I came across the eHealth Ireland’s website.  Here I was able to find data that was collected by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) . As the NTPF’S website details , one of the key tasks for the NTPF is to Collect, collate and validate information on persons waiting for public hospital treatment. eHealth Ireland makes these open datasets more visible to the public. It was here I found the datasets for “IPDC WAITING LIST BY GROUP HOSPITAL”. The IPDC Waiting List report shows the total number of patients waiting, across the various time bands, for Inpatient and Day case treatment in each Specialty. The monthly waiting list figures are published on the NTPF website, and a breakdown of the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list by Adult & Child Analysis is published by hospital. For this assignment I selected the dataset for 2019 as this is the most recent dataset to represent the full year. Currently 2020 is still being updated month by month.

I have also uploaded a supporting word document that explains how I went through this analysis.
