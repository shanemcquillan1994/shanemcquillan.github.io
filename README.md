Here you will find a list of Project I have taken part of.

1) Kaggle Competition for Predicting House Prices using Machine learning.

My main reasoning for choosing this competition was mostly down to the fact that there was test data available for Kaggle to evaluate my performance. From checking out the list of available competitions with available test data , this competition was the most interesting to me. This competition allowed me to put most of what we learned within my postgraduate studies to practice.

While I understand this is not a featured competition with cash prize  , this competition did provide significant challenges for and required a steep learning curve when it came to my python capabilities prior to undertaking it. 
	
From this competition I learned a lot about additional models available within pythons scikit learn library.  Some of the models I implemented within this assignment were not necessarily covered in much depth within class , so it was very beneficial in that regard. All in all , this competition allowed me to demonstrate my  knowledge of machine learning techniques, my ability to apply technical skills to build actual machine learning models, and showed capacity to evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

2) Fifa Data Analysis Using R

For the purpose of data exploration and analysis , I wanted to take a look in to publicly available data regarding FIFA 19.
fIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Sports. The first ever game of Fifa was developed in the year 1993 under the title "Fifa International Soccer".  Over the years the game has seen a dramatic increase in quality and every year pushes the barrier in game development. It is in my opinion that the Data set gathered from this game is probably the most accurate data set publicly available that can represent real world professional soccer. 

Within this R Markdown notebook I explore the Data set and try to get a better picture of the data along the way.

3) Visualisation and analysis of Irelands National Hospitals on case by case basis

I wanted to explore a problem frequently gets discussed within the Irish media from year to year. That being the Irish health system and the problems identified with it. After some research I came across the eHealth Ireland’s website.  Here I was able to find data that was collected by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) . As the NTPF’S website details , one of the key tasks for the NTPF is to Collect, collate and validate information on persons waiting for public hospital treatment. eHealth Ireland makes these open datasets more visible to the public. It was here I found the datasets for “IPDC WAITING LIST BY GROUP HOSPITAL”. The IPDC Waiting List report shows the total number of patients waiting, across the various time bands, for Inpatient and Day case treatment in each Specialty. The monthly waiting list figures are published on the NTPF website, and a breakdown of the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list by Adult & Child Analysis is published by hospital. For this assignment I selected the dataset for 2019 as this is the most recent dataset to represent the full year. Currently 2020 is still being updated month by month.

I have also uploaded a supporting word document that explains how I went through this analysis.


4) Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing with R.

We are all affected by the environment we live in and by the choices we make throughout our life. We are affected by the culture that surrounds us and this very culture shapes who are as beings from childhood adolescence to adulthood. 
  One of the most influential times in our life is our time spent in adolescence (ages 13 - 18). For the majority of this time we will spend within Secondary level education system.Secondary education is vitally important for the individual as well as the collective life (G.R. Memon, 2010). It is Secondary level education that prepares a student for demands of the working society. It is in Secondary education that a student will form their own opinions on society while attempting to expand their knowledge in areas that are considered important in society.
  Along with secondary education , their is a social aspect to adolescence life and certain choices within social scenarios may also take their toll on an individuals life. Social choices such as going out with friends and consuming alcohol have been reported to have negative impact on adolescence life. DeSimone and Wolaver (2005) found that there is a negative causal relation between alcohol consumption and student academic performance, which remains significant for heavy drinking. Williams et al. (2003) reported that heavy drinking has a negative impact on school achievements as heavy drinking reduces the time that student spend on the study.
  Within this project I performed some exploration in to the External Factors that influence Secondary Student’s Mathematics and Portuguese achievements in Portugal.In Portugal. the demand for higher education intensified during the sixties and continued to increase during the fol/owing years in such a way that mechanisms of control over access have been imposed since 1976 ( Maria Manuel, 1996). Despite this fact , about 25% of adults (25-64 year-old) in Portugal have attained tertiary education (OECD, 2012).
  As Secondary education is the precursor to tertiary level education I would like to explore why there is such low volume of graduates from tertiary level education. As I briefly touched on in my introduction , students are affected by external factors that may or may not influence their progression in the education system.
    Within the support zip folder I will explore different factors which may impact the lives of Portuguese secondary level students and their achievements in school. Within this report I will focus on secondary school students’ Mathematics and Portuguese performance in Portugal and also their overall well being. I will explore the relationships these factors have with with final grades and also how well these factors can contribute to predicting the students grades. This is the basis of my researh question.
    
5) Kaggle Competition : Image Classification : Leaf Disease Detection
    
    https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/overview 
    
1. Problem

As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.

The task at hand here is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. 

2. Data

In this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.

3. Evaluation

Submissions were be evaluated based on their categorization accuracy.

Attached within zip "Image_Classification_CassavaDisease_TensorFlowHub.zip" you can find the relevant code within notebook format.


6) Predicting COVID-19 Diagnosis based on CT Scans

1. Problem

This last year has been a strange one in our world. It seems the entire world is coming together to try and tackle the COVID 19 outbreak. It has been the biggest pandemic to rock the world since the Spanish flu ended in 1920.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate that this dataset is useful for developing AI-based diagnosis models of COVID-19. Using this dataset, I aim to develop diagnosis methods based on multi-task learning and self-supervised learning.

2. The Data

During the outbreak time of COVID-19, computed tomography (CT) is a useful manner for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to privacy issues, publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders the research and development of AI-powered diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based on CTs.

This open-sourced dataset -- COVID-CT, contains 349 COVID-19 CT images from 216 patients and 463 non-COVID-19 CTs. The utility of this dataset is confirmed by a senior radiologist who has been diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this pandemic.

The data and code are available at here : https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT

The utility of this dataset has been confirmed by a senior radiologist in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, who has performed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of COVID-19 patients during the outbreak of this disease between January and April.

3. Evaluation

For this project , I will evaluate my model with F1-score. I am doing this simply because it is far more important to ensure that False Negatives and False Positives are taken in to account of importance.

For example , Let's say my model will produce an accuracy in this case = 90% which is a high enough number for the model to be considered as ‘accurate’. However, there are 5 patients who actually have Covid-19 and the model predicted that they don’t have it. Obviously, this is too high a cost. I want my model should try to minimize these False Negatives. This is why I will use F1 score.

F1-score : This is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall and gives a better measure of the incorrectly classified cases than the Accuracy Metric.

In the original report , the study gained an an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans. In this notebook , I will try to better match this or even beat this performance.

4. Features

In this project I am dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.

This is is a binary classification problem, either positive or negative in each case.

There are around 320 positive COVID-19 images in the training set (with or without labels).

There are around 141 negative COVID-19 images in the training set (with or without labels)
